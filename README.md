# SNAKE-GAME
This project models a snake game. In the game, a snake basically grows itself in length whenever it eats one of the food items in the game's board. whenever the snake hits itself, or the walls of the game board, the game is over.

How do I run the program?                   
 **********************************************************************/
1. Compile with "java SnakeGame". 

2. go to view running programming. you will see a big green board
  (that's the perimeter of the game). You will also see a small green square; that's
  the snake. it initially starts with only the head. you will also see 
  a white circle somewhere, and this is the food item. you might also
  see a black circle, and that is a bonus food item

3. click either "a" to move the left, "d" to move right,
   "s" to move down, or "w" to move up

4. if the snake's head collides with either the food item, or 
   the bonus food item, it grows in size by adding to its tail
   a purple square (this is a snake's segment). 

5. press "m" while the game is running to shift to a hard mode.
   in the hard mode, the snake moves faster. You may also press "m"
   again to go back to the normal mode, in which the snake moves slower

6. if the snake's head collides with the board's perimeter, or 
   with one of its segments, the game is over. A screen that shows your score 
   immediately appears. 

7. press "k" to reset the game after the game over.
